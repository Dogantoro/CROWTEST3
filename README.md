# RX Warning
A website for looking up the drug interactions for any pharmaceutical you can take. Interactions are sorted by interaction type and severity. You can also find important info about the drugs themselves and the reactions. This website is great for figuring out which reactions are the worst or the safest when taking multiple medications to ensure you stay safe!

## Instructions
The site can be accessed directly by going to [rx-warning.com](https://rx-warning.com). You can look up a certain drug and get results for what drugs that drug interacts with and what the severity of those interactions are. You can also click on the Random button to get info about the interactions of a random drug. You can also go to Advanced Settings and change the type of data structure used to store the drug interactionsn and see the differences in speed of accessing the drugs and the interactions. The red background indicates the site is using an Adjacency List, and the blue background indicates the usage of an Adjacency Matrix. If there are missing or undefined elements, you can do CTRL+SHIFT+R to clear the cache and make the elements appear again.

If you want to run the server directly on your computer, you would need to install Boost 1.82.0. You need to install that specific version for all of the Boost libraries to work properly. You should also make sure to compile all of the Boost libraries and install standalone Asio.
